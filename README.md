#  Netflix Dataset Cleaning Project

This project is all about cleaning and preparing a Netflix dataset for analysis. The raw data had missing values, messy date formats, and inconsistent column entries â€” so I rolled up my sleeves and gave it a proper cleanup!

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside

- `netflix_cleaned.csv` â€“ The cleaned and processed dataset.
- `netflix_cleaning.py` â€“ Python script I used to clean the data step by step.
- `screenshots/` â€“ A few screenshots showing the original file, cleaned version, and GitHub upload process.

## ðŸ§½ What I Did (Cleaning Steps)

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how I cleaned the data:

### âœ… 1. Renamed Columns
Made column names easier to read and work with in Python (like changing `listed_in` to `genre` and `type` to `content_type`).

### âœ… 2. Filled Missing Data
Some columns had missing info like:
- `country`, `director`, and `cast` â†’ filled with `"Unknown"`
- `rating` â†’ replaced with `"Not Rated"`
- `date_added` â†’ filled with the most frequent date
- `duration` â†’ filled with `"Unknown"`

### âœ… 3. Cleaned Dates
- Converted the `date_added` column into proper date format
- Pulled out the **year** and **month** a title was added to Netflix

### âœ… 4. Fixed Duration Info
- Split the `duration` into two new columns:
  - `duration_num` â†’ the number (like 90)
  - `duration_type` â†’ the unit (like `min` or `Season`)
- Made sure it's ready for analysis

### âœ… 5. Organized the Data
- Sorted everything by `country` (A to Z)
- Then by `content_type` (Movies before TV Shows)

### âœ… 6. Saved the Results
- Exported the final cleaned version into a new file: `netflix_cleaned.csv`
